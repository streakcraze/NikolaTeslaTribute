                    The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.

                <p>Nikola Tesla was an idealist and a futurist, who believed in Science being an instrument that could be used to deliver magnificent phenomena to earth and human lives.</p>
                <p>
                    It is no surprise he became an inventor, having immigrated from the Austrian empire to the United States where he set up shop for the most ambitious ideas in electrical and mechanical devices during his time and beyond. 
                    With the support of financers such as the influential J.P Morgan, he established laboratories and companies in New York before he began his work in building a series of electro-mechanical devices that have survived to the present day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of his inventions include the Tesla coil, the Remote control, neon lamps and induction motors. 
                    Most of these devices show his major contributions to the development of alternating current which is now used to supply most of the world with electricity.
                    He is therefore accredited with being the champion of alternating current generation and transmission.

                <p>
                    Perhaps his most idealistic and ambitious idea was the transmission of wireless electricity throughout the world.
                    His idea was to transmit millions of voltages through either the earth or the atmosphere but settled on the latter moving to Colorado Springs to study the conductive nature of low pressure air.
                    He later got funding from J.P Morgan which he used to build the Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, New York. The tower was intended for transmitting electrical energy across the Atlantic.
                    However, the events following Guglielmo Marconi's successful transmission of the letter S from England to Newfoundland led investors to pull out from Tesla's projects.
                    With no more funding he had to abandon most of his projects which were in later years either torn down or confiscated.
                </p>
                <p>Tesla's inventions however still remain relevant given their great potential in energy distribution. His data were solid and can only be further researched to bring his ideals to fruition.</p>
